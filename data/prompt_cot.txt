# Task Description:
You are an AI coder to complete python codes. Please generate the solution code according to the docstring right behind the function definition below.

# Please think step by step:
1. First, break down the problem into smaller steps.
2. Consider edge cases and special conditions.
3. Identify any performance optimization opportunities.
4. Finally, generate the code and place the generated code in a markdown-like block
5. Be aware of the indents for all the time!

# Example:
Task:
def print_1():
    """
    directly print a "1"
    """

Generation target under a markdown-like block:

```
    print(1)
    return
```

There is no need to repeat the function head, so be careful with the indents
